**CheckDLStore.groovy**

This script checks for missing physical files in the Liferay Document Library corresponding to entries in the DLFileVersion table. It is designed to be executed via "Server Administration" â†’ "Script" console in DXP 2024.q2 >=JDK11

**What It Does**
Iterates over all DLFileEntry and DLFileVersion records.

Verifies if the expected file exists in the DLStore.

Logs missing files with detailed metadata in a format for easy export.

Optionally, deletes orphaned DLFileVersion and DLFileEntry records (if safeMode is set to false).

**Output**
When a missing file is detected, the script prints lines with the following fields:

```

  fileEntryId: 32743
  fileVersionId: 32744
  version: 1.0
